                "It is that range of biodiversity that we must care for - 
                The whole thing - 
                Rather than just one or two stars."
                    David Attenborough

                "Living wild species are like a library of books still unread;
                Our heedless destruction of them is akin to burning the library
                without ever having read its books."

          <h2>World's Most Venomous Snake</h2>
          <p>
            In terms of potency, the most venomous snake in the world is the
            Inland Taipan. These snakes are native to Australia, and although
            their venom is highly toxic, they rarely come in contact with
            humans. In fact, the only reliable documented bite occurrences from
            the Inland Taipan have been with herpetologists who were handling
            them for research purposes.

        <h2>How Roosters Protect Hearing</h2>
        <p>
          Few sounds are more loud and obnoxious than a crowing rooster, and
          apparently the roosters would agree with that sentiment, because they
          have a technique to protect their hearing from their own loud mouths.
          When roosters crow, they tilt their head back. This tilt covers their
          ear canals completely and serves as a sort of built-in ear plug.

        <h2>Polar Bears Aren't Actually White</h2>
        <p>
          We've all been bamboozled by these brazen bears. Polar bear fur,
          although white in appearance, is actually transparent AND hollow. And,
          get this, their skin? It's black. Their black skin helps retain heat,
          as do the hollow hairs.

        <h2>Longest Uninterrupted Flight</h2>
        <p>
          Alpine Swifts are a species of bird found in a lot of places, from
          southern Europe to the Middle East, and even parts of Asia. They also
          hold the world record for the longest recorded uninterrupted flight by
          a bird... over 200 days to be exact!

        <h2>World's Largest Predator</h2>
        <p>
          Sperm Whales are the title holders for being the largest predator in
          the world. They can weigh in at over 80 tons and grow up to 20 meters
          in length! They're so large, they've been known to dive to great
          depths to feast on giant squid. You know, the squid with eyeballs the
          size of basketballs.

        <h2>Corvids Are Super Intelligent</h2>
        <p>
          Corvids (crows, ravens, rooks, etc.) are highly intelligent birds,
          with many demonstrating the ability to mimic sounds and human voices,
          solve puzzles, recognize human faces, and even use tools. But did you
          know that some have even shown the ability to understand physics?
          Studies have shown that some of these birds have the same level of
          understanding physics as a 6 month old human infant, which is a higher
          level of comprehension than many apes.
